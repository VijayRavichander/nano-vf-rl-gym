# Rava Pongal


## About Rava Pongal
It is a simple and tasty breakfast meal recipe made with a combination of moong dal, semolina, and spices. **Rava Pongal**, also known as **Sooji Ka Pongal**, is an alternative to the traditional rice-based variant for those who cannot consume rice-based meals. The recipe steps and ingredients are very similar, with rice being replaced with semolina. However, the cooking is relatively straightforward, as it does not require cooking rice with moong dal.

The recipe is very simple to make, **Rava Pongal**, yet there are many different types of variations to it. The classic Sooji Pongal is made with rava and moong dal, but a masala variant is made with a combination of vegetables, garam masala, and additional spices. Additionally, a millet-based semolina pongal can be prepared to make it healthier. Further, adding mint and coriander paste can introduce a pulao-style pongal.
