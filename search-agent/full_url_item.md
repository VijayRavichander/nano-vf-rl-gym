[6 Notes](http://hebbarskitchen.com/rava-pongal-recipe-semolina-pongal/#Notes)

There are two primary varieties of pongal, which differ significantly in taste. The most popular one is [chakkara or sweet pongal](https://hebbarskitchen.com/sweet-pongal-recipe-chakkara-pongal/ "sweet pongal recipe | sakkarai pongal recipe | chakkara pongal"), which is typically made during the festival season or in temples as prasadam. The other version is [ven pongal](https://hebbarskitchen.com/ven-pongal-recipe-khara-pongal/ "ven pongal recipe | khara pongal recipe | how to make ven pongal") or savoury pongal, which is generally made for morning breakfast and is served with dosa, idli or even with sweet dishes. Both dishes are prepared similarly, using rice and moong dal as their main ingredients. However, for the sweet version,[jaggery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaggery) or sugar is added, and for the savoury, green chilli and pepper are added.In this recipe, I have showcased a savoury version of**rava pongal****,**also known as**semolina pongal,** which can serve as a morning breakfast alternative.

![Image 15: Rava Pongal Recipe](blob:http://localhost/be90ca422ef86b878208159147707836)

The recipe for **rava pongal is****straightforward** to prepare, but some precautions and tips are worth considering while making it. Firstly, for this rava pongal recipe, I have used coarse semolina, also known as Bombay rava. I would not recommend using fine or even Bansi rava, as the medium-sized rava is perfect for this recipe. Secondly, I have roasted the rava before using it in the recipe, which makes it more flavourful and tasty. You can also use store-bought roasted semolina to hasten the cooking process. Lastly, the pongal should have a silky consistency when served for breakfast. Hence, if you are serving it later, warm it and bring it to a smooth state by adding extra water.

About Rava Pongal
-----------------

It is a simple and tasty breakfast meal recipe made with a combination of moong dal, semolina, and spices. **Rava Pongal**, also known as **Sooji Ka Pongal**, is an alternative to the traditional rice-based variant for those who cannot consume rice-based meals. The recipe steps and ingredients are very similar, with rice being replaced with semolina. However, the cooking is relatively straightforward, as it does not require cooking rice with moong dal.

The recipe is very simple to make, **Rava Pongal**, yet there are many different types of variations to it. The classic Sooji Pongal is made with rava and moong dal, but a masala variant is made with a combination of vegetables, garam masala, and additional spices. Additionally, a millet-based semolina pongal can be prepared to make it healthier. Further, adding mint and coriander paste can introduce a pulao-style pongal.

Pongal is a popular South Indian dish made with rice, moong dal, and other dry spices. It is a purpose-based dish, and depending on the time and season, it is either made as a sweet or savoury dish. But this recipe post is dedicated to rava-based pongal, where rice is replaced with semolina to make a dish similar to [upma](https://hebbarskitchen.com/rava-upma-recipe-uppittu-sooji-upma/).  \n\n\n![Sooji Ka Pongal](https://hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rava-Pongal-Recipe-Sooji-Ka-Pongal-2-683x1024.jpeg)\n  \n**Rava Pongal** **Recipe | Semolina Pongal | Sooji Ka Pongal Recipe** with step-by-step photo and video recipe. Pongal recipe is a versatile recipe which can be made with different types of rice alternatives. Traditionally, pongal is often made with rice, but alternatives such as poha, broken wheat, and oats have also become popular. One such popular alternative is rava or semolina, which makes a perfect rava pongal for breakfast.\n\n![Sooji Ka Pongal](https://hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rava-Pongal-Recipe-Sooji-Ka-Pongal-2-683x1024.jpeg)\n\nThere are two primary varieties of pongal, which differ significantly in taste. The most popular one is [chakkara or sweet pongal](https://hebbarskitchen.com/sweet-pongal-recipe-chakkara-pongal/ \"sweet pongal recipe | sakkarai pongal recipe | chakkara pongal\"), which is typically made during the festival season or in temples as prasadam. The other version is [ven pongal](https://hebbarskitchen.com/ven-pongal-recipe-khara-pongal/ \"ven pongal recipe | khara pongal recipe | how to make ven pongal\") or savoury pongal, which is generally made for morning breakfast and is served with dosa, idli or even with sweet dishes. Both dishes are prepared similarly, using rice and moong dal as their main ingredients. However, for the sweet version, [jaggery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaggery) or sugar is added, and for the savoury, green chilli and pepper are added. In this recipe, I have showcased a savoury version of **rava pongal****,** also known as **semolina pongal,** which can serve as a morning breakfast alternative.\n\n![Rava Pongal Recipe](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20696%20464'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Rava Pongal Recipe](https://hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rava-Pongal-Recipe-Sooji-Ka-Pongal-1-1024x683.jpeg)\n\n![Rava Pongal Recipe](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20696%20464'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n![Rava Pongal Recipe](https://hebbarskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rava-Pongal-Recipe-Sooji-Ka-Pongal-1-1024x683.jpeg)\n\nThe recipe for **rava pongal is****straightforward** to prepare, but some precautions and tips are worth considering while making it. Firstly, for this rava pongal recipe, I have used coarse semolina, also known as Bombay rava. I would not recommend using fine or even Bansi rava, as the medium-sized rava is perfect for this recipe. Secondly, I have roasted the rava before using it in the recipe, which makes it more flavourful and tasty. You can also use store-bought roasted semolina to hasten the cooking process. Lastly, the pongal should have a silky consistency when served for breakfast. Hence, if you are serving it later, warm it and bring it to a smooth state by adding extra water.\n\nFinally, be sure to visit my other related [**breakfast recipes collection,**](https://hebbarskitchen.com/recipes/breakfast-recipes/) which includes this post on **rava pongal recipe**.

The recipe steps and ingredients are very similar, with rice being replaced with semolina. However, the cooking is relatively straightforward, as it does not require cooking rice with moong dal.\n\nThe recipe is very simple to make, **Rava Pongal**, yet there are many different types of variations to it. The classic Sooji Pongal is made with rava and moong dal, but a masala variant is made with a combination of vegetables, garam masala, and additional spices. Additionally, a millet-based semolina pongal can be prepared to make it healthier. Further, adding mint and coriander paste can introduce a pulao-style pongal.\n\n### Video Recipe\n\n## Recipe Card for Rava Pongal\n\n![Sooji Ka
