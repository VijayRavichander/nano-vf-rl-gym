    "# Take-Home Project: Agent Task Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a task involving **multi-turn interaction/tool use**\n",
    "- Implement an **agent scaffold** (using a raw API or one of the provided frameworks)\n",
    "- Create a **small set of test prompts**\n",
    "- Define a **reward function** to evaluate your agent's performance\n",
    "- **Test** your agent with **multiple models/prompts**\n",
    "- Analyze agent outputs, identify a consistent **problem**, and either:\n",
    "  - Adjust the **setup** (prompts/tools), or\n",
    "  - Adjust your **evaluations** to capture or address the issue\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Ideas for Agent Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **search agent** for your favorite blog or website\n",
    "- An agent that fills in the rest of the sentence (e.g., “Agent which…”)\n",
    "- An agent to play a **simple board or card game**\n",
    "- A **code agent** that only uses a specific library (e.g., iterates on a matplotlib plot until it “looks right”)\n",
    "- A **terminal-based chat agent** that can hand off to a human or confirm actions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏆 Ideas for Reward Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Format checks** using regex\n",
    "- **Deterministic checks** (e.g., parsing math answers, running code, solving puzzles)\n",
    "- **Embedding or text similarity** compared to a “ground truth”\n",
    "- **LLM judges** that:\n",
    "  - Have access to the ground truth\n",
    "  - Evaluate a set of fuzzy criteria and assign scores\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Start simple**: Get a minimal version working before adding complexity\n",
    "- If your agent \"just works\" with a strong model, try it with a **weaker model** and see where it breaks\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌟 Bonus Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make a **parallel-friendly** version using `asyncio` and error handling\n",
    "- Implement **Best-of-N selection** and test if your reward function aligns with your judgment\n",
    "- Try a **multi-agent setup** or a **Client/Server setup** (e.g., MCP, A2A)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit **a repo**, **notebook**, or **short writeup** with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A description of your **task and setup**\n",
    "- What **approaches** you tried\n",
    "- Any **roadblocks** you ran into\n",
    "- Which **evaluation methods** worked best\n",
    "- What’s the **smallest model** that still performed decently well\n"

      "There are two primary varieties of pongal, which differ significantly in taste. The most popular one is [chakkara or sweet pongal](https://hebbarskitchen.com/sweet-pongal-recipe-chakkara-pongal/ \"sweet pongal recipe | sakkarai pongal recipe | chakkara pongal\"), which is typically made during the festival season or in temples as prasadam. The other version is [ven pongal](https://hebbarskitchen.com/ven-pongal-recipe-khara-pongal/ \"ven pongal recipe | khara pongal recipe | how to make ven pongal\") or savoury pongal, which is generally made for morning breakfast and is served with dosa, idli or even with sweet dishes. Both dishes are prepared similarly, using rice and moong dal as their main ingredients. However, for the sweet version, [jaggery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaggery) or sugar is added, and for the savoury, green chilli and pepper are added. In this recipe, I have showcased a savoury version of **rava pongal****,** also known as **semolina pongal,** which can serve as a morning breakfast alternative.\n",

      "\n",
      "The recipe for **rava pongal is****straightforward** to prepare, but some precautions and tips are worth considering while making it. Firstly, for this rava pongal recipe, I have used coarse semolina, also known as Bombay rava. I would not recommend using fine or even Bansi rava, as the medium-sized rava is perfect for this recipe. Secondly, I have roasted the rava before using it in the recipe, which makes it more flavourful and tasty. You can also use store-bought roasted semolina to hasten the cooking process. Lastly, the pongal should have a silky consistency when served for breakfast. Hence, if you are serving it later, warm it and bring it to a smooth state by adding extra water.\n",

      "About Rava Pongal\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a simple and tasty breakfast meal recipe made with a combination of moong dal, semolina, and spices. **Rava Pongal**, also known as **Sooji Ka Pongal**, is an alternative to the traditional rice-based variant for those who cannot consume rice-based meals. The recipe steps and ingredients are very similar, with rice being replaced with semolina. However, the cooking is relatively straightforward, as it does not require cooking rice with moong dal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recipe is very simple to make, **Rava Pongal**, yet there are many different types of variations to it. The classic Sooji Pongal is made with rava and moong dal, but a masala variant is made with a combination of vegetables, garam masala, and additional spices. Additionally, a millet-based semolina pongal can be prepared to make it healthier. Further, adding mint and coriander paste can introduce a pulao-style pongal.\n",

      "**Mango Sago Recipe | Mango Tapioca Recipe | Mango Sabudana Dessert** with step-by-step photo and video recipe. Summer season is at its peak and it brings a lot of perks and tropical fruits. One such popular tropical fruit is mango and it can be used to prepare several premium desserts and traditional sweets recipes. One such classical yet traditional sweet recipe is the mango sago recipe known for its taste and creamy texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "As I explained earlier, there are several traditional dessert recipes derived from ripe mangoes. Most of these are made to hard sweets like barfi and cakes. However, it can also be made for some smooth creamy pudding-type desserts. One such hugely popular dessert is the **mango sago** or **mango tapioca recipe**. The combination of mango puree with Sabja and Sabudana makes it a premium dessert. In addition, there is a small amount of custard powder added to it. This helps to achieve a creamy and silky smooth texture. Adding custard is not mandatory and the traditional recipe does not include it. However, adding it does not alter the recipe, and adding it only makes it better. Do try this and I am certain you will love it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Furthermore, some more related and additional tips, suggestions, and variations to the **mango sago recipe**. Firstly, I have used fresh ripe mangoes to make the mango puree. This is ideal, but may not be convenient. You may use store-bought puree or even frozen mangoes to make the puree. Secondly, in addition to Sabja and Sabudana, you may add some homemade jellies. This would make it more attractive and appealing, particularly with kids. Lastly, the dessert is best served when it is chilled. You may also add a [vanilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla \"vanilla\") ice cream scoop with some dry fruits topping to it.\n",
